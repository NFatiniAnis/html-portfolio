<h1>The Best Movie According to Fatini (D21314500)</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Cruella</h3>
<p>This is one of my favourite movie because its packed with energy, action, incredible style and somehow inspiring in certain aspects. </p>
<h3>Maleficent: Mistress of Evil</h3>
<p>This is a fairy tale/action movie with an amazing plot and great fantasy for all ages. </p>
<h3>Spies in Disguise</h3>
<p>One of my favourite animation movie and dispite being an animation it does have some sentimental elements in it.</p>
