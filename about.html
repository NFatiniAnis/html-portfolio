<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Nur Fatini Anis Binti Abdul Manap (D21314500)</h2>
<p>I am 19 years old. My birthday is on January 17th. My favourite food 
    is Nasi Kerabu which is blue-colored rice that eaten with 
    fried chicken or fish, crackers and some type of salad. My favourite
    movie is Spies in Disguise which is an animation movie and dispite being 
    an animation it does have some sentimental elements in it. I am a Diploma of 
    Information Technology student semester 2.5 in University Sultan Azlan Shah.
